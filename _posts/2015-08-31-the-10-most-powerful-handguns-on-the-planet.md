description: "The Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum blasted the big-bore handgun into pop culture way back in 1971, as the preferred sidearm of Clint Eastwood's \"Dirty Harry\". Forty-four years later it still ranks among the most powerful production handguns available, but there's no shortage of modern-day power pistols that are even more formidable."
