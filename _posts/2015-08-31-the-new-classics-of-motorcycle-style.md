description: "Style in the motorcycle scene doesn't change a whole lot. You've mostly got leather, denim, boots, gloves, and helmets to play around with, and fashion here tends to be-first and foremost-functional. But motorcycle culture is also about self-expression. So while bright green, high-visibility jackets and bulky, waterproof pants might keep you safe, they're not stylish, and that's no good."
